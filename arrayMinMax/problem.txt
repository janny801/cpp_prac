Given an array of numbers of size N you need to output the minimum (smallest) and maximum (largest) elements from the array.
In the first line you are given the number N that represents how many numbers are in the input (For example if the first number is 3 then there would be 3 more numbers beneath the first number).

Assuming this is the input:


5
25
3
1
56
8


The smallest number is 1 and the largest is 56


Output


1 56


Constraint: all of the numbers are smaller than 108 and bigger than -108
