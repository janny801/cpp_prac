Given the following array of integers:

int numbers[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80};

Create a pointer ptr1 that points to the first element of the array.

Create a pointer ptr2 and assign the value of ptr to it

Increment ptr2 to move to the fourth element

Create ptr3 and give it the value of ptr2 

Decrement ptr3 by 2 positions

Calculate and PRINT the number of elements between the first and last elements in the array,
using pointer subtraction in the following way There are {elements} elements between {first} and {last}
