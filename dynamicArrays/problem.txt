Consider an n-element array, arr, where each index i in arr contains a reference to an array of variable length. 
Given arr, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where i denotes an index in arr and j denotes an index in the array referenced by arr[i]. 
For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location i on a new line.

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
Each of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at arr[i].
Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in arr) and j (an index in the array referenced by arr[i]) for a query.

Constraints:
- All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
- All the given numbers are non-negative and are not greater than 10^5.

Output Format
For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index j of the array referenced by arr[i]. 
There should be a total of q lines of output.

Sample Input:
