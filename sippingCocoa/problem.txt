Create a function named sippingCocoa that receives dipper and sips as its parameters.

The function simulates drinking hot cocoa from a dipper on a cozy winter evening by the fireplace. 
It modifies the contents of the dipper based on the number of sips taken.

Your task is to implement the sipping process and return the final contents of the dipper after all sips have been taken.

Parameters:

dipper (string): A string containing only 'C' and 'M' characters, where 'C' represents hot cocoa and 'M' represents marshmallows.
sips (int): An integer representing the number of sips to take from the dipper.
The function should follow these rules:

Each sip removes one character from the beginning of the string.
After every two sips, if there's still cocoa left in the dipper, add a marshmallow ('M') to the end of the string.
Continue this process until all sips have been taken or the dipper is empty.
The function returns a string representing the final contents of the dipper after all sips have been taken or the dipper is empty.
